Design Decisions:\
The website has been designed to be minimalistic and clean. All content within the pages has \
been centered so as to draw the main focus into the column structure. With memberships \
being one of our main call-to-actions this menu selection has been highlighted on every page so \
as to be the first thing the user will see when interacting with the website. The majority of the \
pages containing large amounts of text have been organised into a more natural feeling layout. \
Another major decision falls to ease of navigation with the layout being designed to be simplistic and \
natural.\

Files to be Updated:\
Files relating to CSS - ./assets/css/src/* all files within\
Files relating to JavaScript - ./assets/js/src/* all files within\
Files relating to PHP files - ./template-parts/* broken down into content/header/footer files\
\
All files within the theme structure have been isolated down so that the files which need to\
be amended contain only the code that is required for that file.
